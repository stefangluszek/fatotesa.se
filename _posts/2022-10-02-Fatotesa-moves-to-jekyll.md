[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. It's a great way to host a static website for free. Together with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) it's a great way to host a blog for free.
